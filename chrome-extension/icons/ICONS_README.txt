Chrome Extension Icons

To complete the Chrome extension setup, you need to add icon files in the following sizes:

Required Icons:
- icon16.png (16×16 pixels)
- icon32.png (32×32 pixels)
- icon48.png (48×48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128×128 pixels)

Design Guidelines:
- Use the app's primary purple color (#7c3aed)
- Include a recognizable symbol (form, AI sparkle, automation icon)
- Ensure icons are clear at small sizes
- Use PNG format with transparency

Quick Icon Generation Options:

1. Use an online icon generator:
   - https://favicon.io/
   - https://www.favicon-generator.org/

2. Design in Figma/Canva:
   - Create a 128×128 purple square with white icon
   - Export in all required sizes

3. Use AI image generation:
   - Prompt: "Simple app icon, purple background, white form/automation symbol"
   - Resize to required dimensions

Once you have the icons, place them in this directory (chrome-extension/icons/)
and the extension will be ready to use!
